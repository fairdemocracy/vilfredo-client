This Javascript client is a work in progress, also helping to refine the vilfredo-core REST API which had previously been unit tested only.

Clone the vilfredo-core  into your development directory workspace. Run setup and the tests which will build the test database.

Clone the vilfredo_client into your development directory workspace where you have cloned the vilfredo-core server.

Eg Using a development directory /Users/[user]/python

cd /Users/[user]/python
git clone https://github.com/fairdemocracy/vilfredo-client.git

Then for now, for development probably the easiest way to work with the client is to cd into the VilfredoReloadedCore subdirectory of the vilfredo-core project and create soft links that point to the client files as follows:

cd vilfredo-core/VilfredoReloadedCore
ln -s /Users/[user]/python/vilfredo-client/static ./static
ln -s /Users/[user]/python/vilfredo-client/templates ./templates

Of course you could also copy the static and template subdirectories into the VilfredoReloadedCore directory of vilfredo-core but this seems easier.

Once you have it ready, go to /static/templates/analytics.template.html and replace UA-XXXXXXXX-X with your Google Analytics ID if you use Google Analytics. If you use any other analytics tool, just replace the file contents with your tracking code. The template will be inserted inside the HEAD tag.
